## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
The most used commands are:

* `npm run dev` - Build and start the app in dev mode at http://localhost:3000
* `npm run test` - Run the tests
* `npm run lint` - Lint the code

Husky is used to run lint and tests before commit, so you don't need to worry about it. It also increases the version number in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` automatically.

If you want to skip it, use `git commit --no-verify`. We recommend you to not do it.
